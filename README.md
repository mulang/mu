# Mu

The Mu language

## Overview

Mu is a new approach to language development. It builds on an emergent living breathing environment. Mu does not attempt to replicate 
the feature set of "programming" languages but instead attempts to define a more human way forward. Mu is not yet ready for real world 
consumption.
